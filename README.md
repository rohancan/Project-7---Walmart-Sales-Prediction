# Project-7---Walmart-Sales-Prediction

Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze the given Walmart Sales dataset, encompassing store numbers, dates, weekly sales, and various factors such as holiday weeks, temperature, fuel prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI), and unemployment rate. The aim is to uncover insights and patterns in the data to understand the impact of these factors on sales performance, identify key drivers of sales, and provide actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies and enhance business outcomes. For the purpose of this project, I will be considering “weekly_sales” to be the target or outcome variable. 

Hypothesis to prove/disprove: Based on the provided dataset, the hypothesis is that specific factors such as holiday weeks, temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rate influence Walmart’s weekly sales performance. We can hypothesize that weeks with special holidays such as Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, will exhibit higher sales compared to non-holiday weeks. Additionally, we anticipate that lower temperatures might positively impact sales, as customers tend to spend more during colder weather. Furthermore, we expect that lower fuel prices, higher CPI, and lower unemployment rates will positively correlate with increased sales. By analyzing this dataset and testing these hypotheses, we aim to gain insights into the relationships existing between these variables and sales performance, enabling data-driven recommendations for improving sales strategies and driving business growth.
